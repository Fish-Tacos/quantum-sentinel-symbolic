## ðŸ§  Simulator-Ready Symbolic Notebooks

This repository now includes updated notebooks and logging logic designed for symbolic anomaly detection using quantum simulations.

### âœ… Features Added
- **AerSimulator Support**:
  - All quantum circuits now run on `qiskit_aer.AerSimulator()` with proper transpilation.
  - Compatible with Qiskit â‰¥ 1.0.

- **Impulse-Based Symbolic Logging**:
  - Each notebook run ends with a symbolic logger prompt.
  - Captures observer notes, raw counts, and system parameters.

- **Automatic Symbolic Context Detection**:
  - Background logging of:
    - Moon phase (as lunar cycle fraction)
    - Fibonacci alignment (is today a Fibonacci-numbered day?)
    - Symbolic musical interval (assigned by weekday)

- **Dual-Format Log Output**:
  - `logs/symbolic_log.csv` and `logs/symbolic_log.json`
  - Ready for downstream statistical or symbolic analysis
