# Prereg: Pilot-01 (Aug 2025)

- **Symbols under test:** Eye of Ra (primary)
- **Hypothesis (directional):** Resonance-tagged days will show higher daily event counts than non-resonance days.
- **Primary metric:** Daily total events in `data/logs/symbolic_log.json`
- **Secondary metric:** Daily events where `resonance == true`
- **Design:** 28 days in ABAB blocks (A = baseline; B = user-tagged resonance allowed)
- **Alpha:** 0.05 (two-sided)
- **Primary tests:** (a) Block-level difference in means; (b) Poisson rate ratio (B vs A)
- **Stopping rule:** Fixed 28-day window; no interim peeking-driven changes.
- **Deviations policy:** Any change to metrics/tests must be committed here before analysis.
- **Analyst:** OC (primary), Ariel Spock (observer)
