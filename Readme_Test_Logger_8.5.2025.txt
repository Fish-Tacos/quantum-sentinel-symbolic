## 📜 Overview

The **Quantum Watchtower** is an experimental system designed to explore the relationship between **symbolic resonance** (archetypes, patterns, celestial events) and quantum computation. It investigates whether consciousness and symbols can correlate with anomalous patterns in quantum simulation outputs — potentially detecting unknown organizing influences.

The system includes:
- A **daily symbolic logger** (GitHub Action)
- A **symbolic resonance tracker**
- Integration with IBM Qiskit or simulators
- Manual and automated data entry pipelines
- Real-time symbolic logging into `symbolic_log.csv`
- Background symbolic metadata (Fibonacci days, moon phases, celestial events)

## 🧪 Example Use Case

When a user experiences a **moment of symbolic resonance** — e.g., seeing a spiral in nature, a significant celestial event, or an emotional insight — they manually trigger a quantum run. The symbolic context is logged and correlated with quantum measurement results for anomaly analysis.
