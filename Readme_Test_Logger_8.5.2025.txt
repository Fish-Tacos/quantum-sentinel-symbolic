# Quantum Watchtower 🌀

> Symbolic Resonance Tracker & Logger Update – August 6, 2025  
> ✅ New Files Added Tonight:
> - `test_logger_run_UPDATED.py`
> - `logger_with_symbol_learning.py`
> - Updated `symbolic_log.csv` with new resonance entries (Spiral, Comet ATLAS 3I, Triskelion)

## 📜 Overview

The **Quantum Watchtower** is an experimental system designed to explore the relationship between **symbolic resonance** (archetypes, patterns, celestial events) and quantum computation. It investigates whether consciousness and symbols can correlate with anomalous patterns in quantum simulation outputs — potentially detecting unknown organizing influences.

The system includes:
- A **daily symbolic logger** (GitHub Action)
- A **symbolic resonance tracker**
- Integration with IBM Qiskit or simulators
- Manual and automated data entry pipelines
- Real-time symbolic logging into `symbolic_log.csv`
- Background symbolic metadata (Fibonacci days, moon phases, celestial events)

---

## 🧪 Example Use Case

When a user experiences a **moment of symbolic resonance** — e.g., seeing a spiral in nature, a significant celestial event, or an emotional insight — they manually trigger a quantum run. The symbolic context is logged and correlated with quantum measurement results for anomaly analysis.

## ⚙️ Key Scripts

- `test_logger_run_UPDATED.py`  
  Adds a symbolic entry manually, specifying the symbol (e.g., *Eye of Ra*, *Spiral*, etc.)

- `logger_with_symbol_learning.py`  
  Core logger that adds automatic symbolic metadata:
  - Moon phase
  - Fibonacci day check
  - Celestial proximity (e.g., Comet ATLAS 3I)

## 🔭 Vision

This project operates on the hypothesis that **symbols may encode structure within reality** — detectable not just by the mind, but by quantum measurements. It is an attempt to **probe symbolic resonance at the edge of consciousness and computation.**
